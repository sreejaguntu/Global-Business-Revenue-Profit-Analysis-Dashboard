📊 Global Business Revenue & Profit Analysis Dashboard | MS Excel
Overview

This project showcases a complete data analytics workflow using Microsoft Excel. It includes raw data cleaning, calculated fields (Year, Month, Profit %), multiple PivotTables and PivotCharts, and a consolidated interactive dashboard. The dashboard visualizes key business metrics such as revenue, expenses, product-wise profit, regional performance, and payment method analysis. Ideal for demonstrating Excel-based analytics and dashboarding skills for aspiring data analysts.


I took a raw dataset of global business transactions and transformed it into an interactive, insight-driven dashboard that highlights key business metrics across regions, products, departments, and payment methods.

The project covers data cleaning, transformation, PivotTables, PivotCharts, and dashboard design, showcasing the ability to turn raw data into actionable insights.
